# Intrusion-Detection
Network security and Intrusion Detection in Cyber Security.
Abstract:
The increasing reliance on networked systems in both personal and professional contexts has elevated the importance of network security. This project focuses on understanding and improving network security by employing intrusion detection systems (IDS). IDSs are critical for identifying and responding to potential threats in real-time. This project explores the existing network security landscape, identifies gaps, and proposes an enhanced IDS framework to better detect and mitigate intrusions. Through implementation and testing, the proposed system demonstrates improved accuracy and response times, contributing to more robust cybersecurity defenses.

Existing System:
Current network security systems utilize a variety of tools and protocols to protect against intrusions. Key components include firewalls, antivirus software, and IDS. However, existing IDS implementations often struggle with high false-positive rates and the inability to detect new or sophisticated attacks. Traditional IDS systems are categorized into:
Signature-Based IDS: Detects attacks by comparing incoming data against a database of known threat signatures. Limitation: Ineffective against new, unknown threats.
Anomaly-Based IDS: Monitors network traffic and compares it to an established baseline of normal activity. Limitation: High false-positive rates due to the dynamic nature of network traffic.

Proposed System
The proposed system aims to enhance the effectiveness of intrusion detection by integrating machine learning techniques with traditional IDS methods. This hybrid approach combines the reliability of signature-based detection with the adaptability of anomaly-based detection. Key features of the proposed system include:
Machine Learning Integration: Use of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives.
Real-Time Analysis: Implementation of real-time traffic monitoring and analysis to quickly identify and respond to threats.
Scalability: Design of a scalable system that can be deployed across different network environments.
